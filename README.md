I am a cybersecurity professional-in-training with a strong interest in defensive security and forensic analysis.

## Objective

I am currently working on my BS in Cybersecurity (expected graduation: July 2025) while also gaining hands-on experience as an ISP help desk technician. I plan to utilize my education and professional experience to transition into a cybersecurity role by mid 2026. Until then, I will grow my skills in cybersecurity concepts and tools and update my Github portfolio to reflect what I am learning!
